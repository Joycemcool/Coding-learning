Overview
Date-time data can be frustrating to work with in R. R commands for date-times are generally unintuitive and change depending on
the type of date-time object being used. Moreover, the methods we use with date-times must be robust to time zones, leap days, daylight savings times, 
and other time related quirks, and R lacks these capabilities in some situations. Lubridate makes it easier to do the things R does with date-times and
possible to do the things R does not.
